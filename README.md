EegeoTree.js is a JavaScript program which will read a text file containing PointName, X coord and Y coord separated by a space. Each point is on a new line.

The program will find the point most isolated point on the map at a complexity of O(n log n).

"Node EegeoTree.js" will run the program for problem_big.txt.
